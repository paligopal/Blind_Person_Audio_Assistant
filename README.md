# Blind_Person_Audio_Assistant

- Obstacle, Fire and Smoke Detector for Visually Impaired Person
  - In this work, we have developed a portable, versatile and simple simulated circuit model to help the blind person.
  - The proposed model is able to detect the object upto twenty one meters distance with the view of 360 degree.
  - The proposed model is able to classify the object using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm.
  - The Common Object In Context (COCO) dataset is used for classification.
  - The model is able to measure the distance of the object from the blind person using Sound Navigation & Ranging (SONAR) technique.
  - The model is also able to detect the fire & smoke.
  - The microcontroller is used to take the input from the different sensors, and to analyze the inputs as per the feeded algorithm inside the controller and subsequently to generate a desired output.
  - The generated output in text form is transferred to the smartphone application via bluetooth.
  - Smartphone application is designed in such a way that it converts the text into the audio.
  - Finally the audio output is delivered to blind person via smartphone speaker so that the blind person can hear about the things going around and can take the appropriate step in the journey.
